# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an instant messaging application that enables real-time communication between multiple users across different devices. The application will feature alias-based user identification, real-time messaging capabilities using the instant-db JavaScript library, and a clean, intuitive user interface inspired by popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. The frontend will be built using React with shadcn/ui components for a modern, accessible user experience.
